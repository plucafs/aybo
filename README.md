# How it works
On Firefox:
- Go in Setting or paste this *about:preferences* your address bar: 
- Select the Home category
- In Homepage and new windows select Custom URLs
- Paste this https://plucafs.github.io/aybo/
- At the startup this is the first page the browser will load
- Everything you write in the box is stored in the localStorage, so will persist after the close
